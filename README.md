# MPMD with Fortran 2008 Coarrays Repository

# Overview
This Repository is dedicated to a programming style that allows MPMD-like parallel programming using Fortran 2008 Coarrays (PGAS). Most of the files herein were firstly published on the website www.mpmd-with-coarray-fortran.de. The example code of this Repositiry is intented to be the first one in a series of follow-up examples and as such probably the most simple one, hopefully suitable as an entry level to others. Our programming style is object-based, using Fortran 95 style Abstract Data Types (ADT).
