# MPMD with Fortran 2008 Coarrays Repository

# Overview
This Repository is dedicated to a programming style that allows MPMD(Multiple-Program Multiple-Data)-like parallel programming using Fortran 2008 Coarrays (PGAS). Most of the files herein were firstly published on the website www.mpmd-with-coarray-fortran.de. The example code of this Repositiry is intented to be the first one in a series of follow-up examples and is probably the most simple one, hopefully suitable as an entry level to others.

Our programming style is object-based, using Fortran 95 style Abstract Data Types (ADT). Thus, you should have some Fortran 95 coding experiences as well as some basic object-based programming experiences. A basic knowledge of parallel programming with coarrays is also required. To start, you should read the short paper 'MPMD with Coarray Fortran (2008): an Example Program' (pdf format) in the Repositrys main folder or at http://www.mpmd-with-coarray-fortran.de/MPMD_with_Coarray_Fortran_2008.pdf. Chapter 2 may serve as a first preparation to understand the MPMD example program, whereas chapter 3 explains the example program in more detail.
